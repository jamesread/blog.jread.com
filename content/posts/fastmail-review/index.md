A couple of years ago I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for my email, and I have to say I've been super impressed. The reason that I switched from Gmail was that I was becoming less and less willing to support big tech companies that were not respecting my privacy, and Google is one of the worst offenders. 

Fastmail was one the few candidates that a took a look at, and honestly I cannot remember now what other providers I looked at. What impressed me about Fastmail was that they are a company entirely focussed on email. They are not trying to sell you anything else, and they are not trying to sell your data. They'd also come up on a few tech podcasts I listened to, which is always a good sign! 

The interface is clean and simple, it's always fast. Uptime has been impressive (and I don't think I've ever had any outage). The mobile app is also very good, and I use it every day. Thanks Fastmail for being part of my stack!
