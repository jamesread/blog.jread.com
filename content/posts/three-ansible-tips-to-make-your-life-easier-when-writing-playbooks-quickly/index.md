We’ve all been there, you just want to hack up a quick Ansible playbook to do a quick task, and then you find yourself fighting with syntax, chopping and changing things around, wondering why this simple Ansible playbook isn’t working. Let me give you a few hints to make your life easier.

This is especially useful if you’re on a new machine that doesn't come with all your personal configuration, dotfiles and preferred editors! This happens to me quite a lot when setting up new environments.

## 1) shebang your playbooks! Aherm.

You’ve seen it a thousand times, looking at bash scripts, python code, etc, the comment at the top of the file that tells your shell how to execute it.

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    echo “I am a funky Bash script”

…. and in python…

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    echo “Hello from python!”

Well, this line starting with “#!” is a “[shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))”. There’s no reason you cannot use that with Ansible too, making it much quicker than typing “ansible-playbook … “ every time to execute it.

    #!/usr/bin/env ansible-playbook
    ---
    hosts: 
      - server

    ...

and execute like this;

    ./myPlaybook.yml

Much nicer! And as long as you use “env” to find ansible-playbook, you can still pass standard arguments;

    ./myPlaybook.yml -i myInventory -v

## 2) tab-stop, and smart indent (vim)

I use Vim, with quite a long [.vimrc that is Git version controlled](https://github.com/jamesread/scripts/blob/master/vimrc.txt), but often this isn’t available on hosts that I ssh into into infrequently. Don’t be afraid of spending 15 seconds writing a new .vimrc file that makes writing those damned YAML files a whole lot easier — tab-stop and smart indenting.

    set ts=2
    set smartindent

These two lines, when added to your **~/.vimrc **file will save you oodles of time. YAML is really sensitive to tab widths, and vim will default to 4 spaces — throwing all your nice YAML with syntax errors in time.

Smart intenting allows vim to follow your current tab, and when you press “Enter” for a new line, it will start at your current tab column width. This, again, makes editing yaml with Vim so much quicker.

## 3) Don’t be afraid to specify hosts in the playbook

Ideally, every playbook should be written so it can work with any number of hosts, but if you’re just doing a quick, simple task, then you can just use /etc/ansible/hosts as your inventory and limit your hosts statically in a playbook, see below;

**example /etc/ansible/hosts**

    [webservers]
    server1
    server2

    [databases]
    server3

Here are two examples below — note that the “-” in Ansible indicates a list (as per the individual server name example), otherwise, it’s a single item (as per the hostgroup example).

Example quick and dirty playbook, **statically set for 2x hosts;**

    hosts: 
      - server1
      - server2
    tasks:
      - debug:
          msg: "Hello from {{ ansible_hostname }}!"

Example quick and dirty playbook, **statically set for a hostgroup;**

    hosts: databases
    tasks:
      - debug:
          msg: "Hello from {{ ansible_hostname }}!"

## Summary

Those were 3 quick tips to making your life easier when writing quick Ansible playbooks! I hope that helps ;)
