In 2019 I could see that AI was a technology gaining increasing interest and relevance, and I wanted to learn more. At the time I was feeling like my day to day routine was getting a bit boring, and too familiar, and I wanted to make sure I had a solid grasp of what I thought would become a fundamental building block of technology for the future, and I decided to take a course on the topic of AI. Despite anticipating it's increased importance in our day to day lives, I absolutely did not anticipate just how big AI would be in 2024. Technologies like ChatGPT have become readily available to everyone, and they seem like magic.

Over the next few years, it seems almost inevitable just how pervasive AT will become. Looking at 2024, AI takes up a huge amount of news airtime and software roadmaps, and it shows no chance of slowing down, or the hype bubble popping anytime soon.

Despite AI being a topic that is constantly changing and evolving, I'm delighted that the course I took back in 2019 continues to be relevant today. Looking at the content and structure of this course, you can see it taught AI concepts (which have aged well), rather than AI technologies (which would have aged poorly). Let's look at the 6 modules included in this short course.

## Module 1: Artificial intelligence: What is all the hype about?
## Module 2: AI's engine room: how do machines learn?
## Module 3: Current frontiers: deep learning and the latest trends in AI
## Module 4: Working with intelligent machines
## Module 5: Setting the boundaries of AI
## Module 6: Making a business case for AI

After writing out that list of modules, I started writing out a list of learnings from this course in 2019 that I still use today, and found myself at 3 pages without slowing down. Clearly I need to break this into several blog posts.

Some of the topics I hope to write about are;

* [Why is AI happening now?]({{< relref "../why-is-ai-happening-now/" >}})

I could probably write many, many blog articles just from what I learned in this course. Let me highlight what I think have been the most profound learnings for me back in 2019, that I still use today.
